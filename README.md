# Slack_tasking_py
File attached is code to create a slack app that lets the user click on a message and automatically populate it into a monday board
Our use case is, a meeting summary is sent in a slack channel with: meeting notes + actions.  We want to be able to click those actions and automatically populate into a live tasking board for that project.
